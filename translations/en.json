    "gravitationalWaves": "Gravitational Waves from Black Hole Mergers",
    "gravitationalWavesDesc1": "In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves for the first time. These waves were produced by the collision of two black holes, confirming a major prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.",
    "gravitationalWavesDesc2": "Since then, dozens of black hole mergers have been detected through gravitational waves, providing a new way to study these cosmic phenomena and test our understanding of gravity."
